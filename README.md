[AOC 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019/about)

Please create a new directory for each day. Example: `01` for the first day. In each day we will
create a README.md that has the problem description. Also, add any downloadable resources into this
directory.

To add your solution, add a directory with your name inside the day and put your solution inside.

## Example Folder Structure

```text
+ 01
  - README.md
  - resource.txt
  + en0
    - part_one.py
    - part_two.py
    - sample_resource.txt
    - Makefile
  + kunningklown
    - part_one.py
    - part_two.py
    - sample_resource.txt
    - Makefile
```

The make file is optional but it is covienent for running test data vs actual data.
